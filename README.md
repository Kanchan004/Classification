# Classification
## This repository contains the classification task in which two datasets( train-test) are loaded and models like logistic regression, decision tree and random forest are trained.
## Also the hyperparameter tuning is done for the better performance.
## Steps:
# Firstly, both training and testing datasets are loaded.
# Dataset is preprocessed for the categorical variables.
# Models are trained and tested(Logistic regression, decision tree and random forest).
# Evaluation metrices are calculated.
# Also the hyperparameter tuning is done using gridsearch.

## It is concluded that hyperparameter tuning helps with the better result and proper training of the models.
